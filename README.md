Orderly DOCS https://orderly.network/docs/home sections: Build On Omnichain and SDKs are primary; and within SDKs the “Migrate to SDK v2” and “EVM Perp SDK” being key. 
And the [EVM] React hooks: https://orderly.network/docs/sdks/hooks/overview Overview of Orderly Hooks SDK@orderly.network/hooks The hooks libraries provides a series of React hooks for React developers to ensure a seamless integration experience. This library is a package built on top of @orderly.network/core and @orderly.network/perp
Orderly js-sdk https://github.com/OrderlyNetwork/js-sdk is the core code modules for functionality; referred to in the Migrate to SDK v2 doc section.

EVM & Solana Perp Markets Bot
A basic front end –
•	Wallet Connect
•	Chart
•	Order entry, TP SL, Leverage
•	Position and Account Management.
•	In addition to pull the APIs for dynamic 3 months charts, basic indicators, perps analytics (funding, long/short ratios, open interest, liquidation levels) and feed to SQLite db. 1 minute intervals. 
(Do not need the Orderbook)
Not building a DEX, Im building a Perp trading bot on the Orderly Network. But it appears one of the UIs/apps has to be chosen to first setup functions and connections.
